Imbalanced Time-Series Data Regression Using Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks

	During the collection of time-series data, many reasons lead to imbalanced and incomplete datasets. Consequently, when training deep convolutional models on these datasets, the models suffer from overfitting and lack generalizability to unseen data. In this work, we investigated a new framework of Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGANs) as a solution to improve the extrapolation and generalizability of the regression models in such datasets. We used an imbalanced synthetic dataset to show the advantage of a cGAN generator vs. a standalone CNN model. For more details about the data synthesized and the methods, please read our paper entitled "Imbalanced Time-Series Data Regression Using Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks" which will be available in the proceedings of ICMLA 2022. 

	To run this code, create a Python environment that contains the following libraries (numpy, pickle, os, random, math, tensorflow=2.5.0, sklearn, scipy=1.7.3, matplotlib), then run main.py. The synthesized data, trained models and results are saved in main_results folder.
